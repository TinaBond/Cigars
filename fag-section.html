            HOW TO CHOOSE A CIGAR?
        </h3>
        <p class="faqaccordion_answer">Wider cigars are generally a mellower smoke. A narrow cigar has a slightly higher
            burn temperature and its flavor is dominated by the wrapper, which results in a stronger-tasting smoke. The
            length of a cigar also affects your experience.

            WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT CUBAN CIGARS?
        </h3>
        <p class="faqaccordion_answer">Tobacco has been grown in Cuba for hundreds of years, and manufacturers have been
            making cigars in this country since the time of Phillip II of Spain. In Cuba, there is the perfect
            combination of climate, tobacco leaf quality and the availability of modern technologies.
